MERGE SORT ALGORITHM

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MERGE SORT ALGORITHM

The program takes array inputs from the user and then invokes the merge_sort function to sort the array.
This function employs the divide and conquer algorithm to divide the array into subarrays which have 1 element each .This is achieved by the use of recursion.
After the subdivisions,the subarrays are compared and then merged together into sorted subarrays and finally a sorted array is obtained.This sorting takes logarithmic time to sort the given array.
The algorithm gives up on space as it requires extra memory to store the subarrays-it is an out of place sorting algorithm
Time Complexity O(logn)
Spaxe Complexity O(n)
